# Coding Challenge - 014: Check Consecutive Vowels

The purpose of this coding challenge is to write a program that checks if a word contains consecutive vowels or not.

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of this coding challenge, students will be able to;

- Analyze a problem, identify, and apply programming knowledge for an appropriate solution.

- Implement conditional statements effectively to solve a problem.

- Implement loops to solve a problem.

- Execute operations on strings.

- Demonstrate their knowledge of algorithmic design principles by solving the problem effectively.

## Problem Statement

In this coding challenge, you are going to write a program that takes a string and checks if it contains consecutive vowels or not. It should give `Positive` as an output if it contains consecutive vowels and `Negative` otherwise. For example `saetqi` string contains `a` adjacent to `e`, which means that it contains consecutive vowels. So it should give `Positive` as an output. On the other hand, if you take the string of `statoqag`, the output should be `Negative`.

- Expected Output:

```text
Please enter a string: gasdph
Negative

Please enter a string: aiou
Positive

Please enter a string: taoum
Positive

Please enter a string: a
Negative
```
